usr_07.txt :
============

* If you want to edit another file, but not write the changes in the current
file yet, you can make it hidden: >

	:hide edit foo.txt

The text with changes is still there, but you can't see it.  This is further
explained in section |22.4|: The buffer list.

* :next and :previous to move to different files.

After jumping to another file, you can use two predefined marks which are very
useful: >

	`"

This takes you to the position where the cursor was when you left the file.
Another mark that is remembered is the position where you made the last
change: >

	`.
