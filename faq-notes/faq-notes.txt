* You can press the CTRL-D key after typing the help keyword to get a list of
all the help keywords containing the supplied pattern.

From the help window, you can use the ":tag" command to search for
keywords. For example,

    :tselect /window

You can use the ":helpgrep" command to search for the given text in all the
help files. The quickfix window will be opened with all the matching lines.

							*:file_f*
:f[ile][!] {name}	Sets the current file name to {name}.  The optional !
			avoids truncating the message, as with |:file|.
			If the buffer did have a name, that name becomes the
			|alternate-file| name.  An unlisted buffer is created
			to hold the old name.
